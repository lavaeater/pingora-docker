    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.

      # In this example, we share the folder `db-data` in our root repository, with the default PostgreSQL data path.
      # It means that every time the repository is modifying the data inside
      # of `/var/lib/postgresql/data/`, automatically the change will appear in `db-data`.
      # You don't need to create the `db-data` folder. Docker Compose will do it for you.
